<p class="ex1">

With the rising concerns of climate change and the development of new technology, electric vehicles have
  had a sudden growth in popularity. the main goal is to reduce the amount of emissions produced by vehicle
  usage on a day to day basis. This has been greatly aided by government schemes and incentives to push its
  development further and to persuade new consumers to switch from combustion engines to electric. With some
  research into consumer opinions, we can also see that the key factors when looking to purchase are their
  environmental and long-term financial benefits of ownership. People are also willing to spend slightly more
  on EVs than they usually would with traditional vehicles which further backs up their growth in popularity
  and their future potential in the current and future markets.

<p class="ex1">

Electric vehicles (EV) have been around since the first half of the 19th century but have never really
been the preferred choice of power over combustion engines which have dominated the automotive market
for most of its existence. In recent years EVs have increased in popularity due to the rising
worries of climate change and the impact combustion engines are having on it. As a result of this, EV
stock and sales have been rapidly increasing since 2011 (fig 1)

Governments all around the world are implementing brand new schemes in hopes to gradually shift the market
  to be mainly electric. The UK have begun by setting minimum annual targets for EV sales starting from 22%
  of total cars sold in 2024 to 100% in 2035

  <a href="#(Department for Transport. 2023)">(Department for Transport. 2023)</a>.
  
  This change was initially meant to happen by 2030 but due to
  the current cost of living crisis the UKs Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, has pushed our target back a further
  5 years stating that, “The upfront cost is still high – especially for families struggling with the cost of
  living. Small businesses are worried about the practicalities. And we’ve got further to go to get that
  charging infrastructure truly nationwide.” 
  
  <a href="#Prime Minister’s Office. (2023)">(Prime Minister’s Office. 2023)</a>.
  
  This is a clear sign that the
  infrastructure that is needed to support electric cars is nowhere near ready as manufacturers were not
  prepared for this sudden rise in EVs, and clearly shows that the technology we currently have isn’t developed
  enough to be affordable for the public.

</p>
    
<p class="ex1">
  
  In 2010 an online survey in Germany asked a range of different people ranging from EV users all the way down
  to people who weren’t interested in EVs at all. The survey was quite profound but there were a few key aspects
  which stood out. They were asked to rate from 1-10 the likelihood each development or measure would have on
  their purchase decisions of EVs (Fig 2). The two highest reasons for purchase were the ‘Improvement of
  environmental aspects’ and ‘Financial incentive’ with the other two having neutral ratings. These factors
  are the main persuaders in purchasing an EV in todays market and developments are constantly being made in
  order to improve these to hopefully go completely EV in the near future. Another part of the survey asked
  people how much more they’d be willing to spend on an EV as opposed to a combustion vehicle (Fig 3). Current
  EV users at the time of the survey, who may know more on how promising the EV industry would turn out to be,
  were found to be willing to pay a significant amount more than the rest. This may be due to their understanding
  on the environmental aspects and financial benefits as reported on in the previous figure. This survey was
  conducted in 2010, at the same time as the rise in EV sales was taking place, which meant the whole EV market
  was still in its very early stages. Since this the technology in EVs and availability of them has skyrocketed
  due to the newfound interest in reversing climate change as well as being a more sustainable society.

  Vehicular transport is one of the leading contributions to greenhouse gases and climate change. This is the main
  reason pushing manufacturers and governments to look for more sustainable transport solutions in hopes to reduce
  their contribution. Unlike combustion vehicles, EVs produce zero carbon emissions whilst operating making them the
  leading solution to contribute to a cleaner planet. Manufacturers have begun developing new technologies to make
  EVs more affordable to make the shift less costly on families who may not be able to currently afford EVs. Most
  advancements made in recent years are aimed at making the vehicles more efficient in terms of battery range, battery
  capacity and other systems such as regenerative braking which aims to convert the wasted energy caused during breaking
  back into useful energy to recharge the battery. Due to all these systems being developed by different companies there
  is a lot of competition within each sector, and with each new advancement the buying price of these cars is a lot
  higher than that of your usual combustion engine vehicle.
  
</p>
    
<p class="ex1">   

  Despite this higher purchase price, the long-term operating costs and reduced fuelling costs are significantly less
  than combustion engines making certain EVs far more affordable in the long run as they don’t require as much
  maintenance to keep them running. If this wasn’t enough to make consumers purchase an EV, the UK government ran a
  “plug-in car grant” from 2011 up until 2022 which gave a discount on vehicles with zero emissions. Since then, the
  “EV ChargePoint Grant” was put in place to replace this which “offers financial help for electric smart chargepoint
  installations at domestic/residential properties.” 
  
  <a href="#Lewis, H. (2023)">(Lewis, H. 2023)</a>.
  
  With this grant people can expect up to 75%
  of the cost of their chargepoint to be funded to help more people start driving EVs.

  </p>
<p class="ex1">

  Hopefully in the coming years the infrastructure to support an almost fully EV society will come into place, as well as
  giving more people the opportunity to purchase more affordable EVs. This will be a huge change that needs everyone working
  together for it to happen on a worldwide scale to achieve the targets that have been set. Overall, this will have a very
  positive impact on our society as it will reduce the general running costs for owning a vehicle, as well as reducing the
  impact that day to day commuting has on climate change without making it too hard for our society to adjust to the changes
  being implemented.
